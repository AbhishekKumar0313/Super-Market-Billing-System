# Super Market Billing System üõí

A C++ console-based application designed for managing billing operations in a supermarket. This system allows users to add items, track inventory, and generate bills dynamically.

## Features ‚ú®

- **Add Items**: Users can add items to the system with details like item name, rate, and quantity.
- **Generate Bills**: Users can generate bills based on items in stock and their quantities.
- **Update Inventory**: The system automatically updates item quantities as they are billed.

## Technologies Used üõ†Ô∏è

- **C++**: Core programming language used for the application logic.
- **File Handling**: Utilized file I/O operations to store and update item data in text files.
- **Windows API**: Used for system operations such as clearing the console screen and pausing execution.

## Setup and Installation ‚öôÔ∏è

1. **Download the Source Code**:
   - Clone or download the repository containing the `super_market_billing.cpp` file.

2. **Compile the Code**:

3. **Run the Application**:
   - Execute the compiled binary:
     ```bash
